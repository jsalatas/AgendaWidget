# Android Agenda Widget

Combines calendar events and also tasks in a compact and minimalistic way. When the project started 
I didn't know what exactly I needed, but I knew that I just wanted to have as much information as
possible in my home screen. 

I ended up in UI shown in screenshots. In my way there I needed to experiment on different layouts and
be able to play with settings related to either the widget's UI (background, fonts and colors, date
and time formats, etc), or the ability to quickly show/hide events and tasks and group and display 
these in various ways. It is highly customizable I would say, so I believe it might fit your needs
as well. 

It can connect to android's calendar system and the following task providers
- [Open Tasks](https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks) (compatible with owncloud's and nextcloud's task apps)
- [Astrid Clone](https://github.com/tasks/tasks)
- GTasks

but in practice I'm only using Open Tasks, so the other two might not even work and I'm not willing to 
support these :)

That's why I'm releasing the code under the MIT License. Forking and relisencing is highly recommended, 
although pull requests are also welcomed. :)
